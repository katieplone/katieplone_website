**Quantitative Variables:**

**Categorical Variables:**

Name, Sex, Breed, Color, Size, Coat Length, Neutered, Housebroken, Likes People, Likes Children, Gets along with Males, Gets along with Females, Gets along with Cats, Environment to Keep in

**Chosen Variables**

When I chose this data set, my goal in mind was to analyze the relationship between the various characteristics that are considered when a dog is listed for adoption. I decided to focus on the categorical variables in the data set because the dates included are not extremely relevant to the adaptability of a dog. The variables I chose to analyze are sex, size, coat length, neutered, housebrojen, likes people, likes children, gets along with males, gets along with females, and gets along with cats.

By creating visualizations which examine the relationship between these categorical variables, I hoped to be able to make inferences about which characteristics are favorable to adopters and which coincide with other variables.
